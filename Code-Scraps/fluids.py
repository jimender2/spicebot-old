<deathbybandaid> .poop DoubleD
<SpiceBot> deathbybandaid overestimated their capabilities and poops themselves. DoubleD is not impressed.
<deathbybandaid> I never seem to get that right
<deathbybandaid> dysonparkes might make poop moduler again, and apply some of the new claims logic for bladder to bowel capacity
<under_score> oh my that is crazy
<deathbybandaid> dysonparkes could write a whole game that implements the full body?
<deathbybandaid> .spit
<deathbybandaid> That could be a thing
<deathbybandaid> Ooohhhhh like a virtual person
<deathbybandaid> Could merge in .pint
<under_score> that is a lot
<deathbybandaid> If anybody is funny enough to write that code, it's dysonparkes
<under_score> for sure
<deathbybandaid> .tap dysonparkes
<SpiceBot> Hey dysonparkes,,,, you there?
<deathbybandaid> .echo dysonparkes
<SpiceBot>  dysonparkes
<SpiceBot>  dysonparkes
<SpiceBot>  dysonparkes
<deathbybandaid> Saying name 3 times is a summons, right?

<dysonparkes> How are you envisaging this?
<deathbybandaid> dysonparkes I was thinking a full game of bodily fluids?
<dysonparkes> In what sense?

<deathbybandaid> Bowel capacity determines if you poop your pants, or fart
* dysonparkes knees deathbybandaid in the crotch, causing bladder voiding. 20 points!
<deathbybandaid> Spit requires saliva?
<deathbybandaid> Idk
<dysonparkes> You want me to 'gamify' shitting/spitting/bleeding?
<deathbybandaid> Along with peeing in claims
<dysonparkes> Have no limit on bleeding, just make it randomly have you die from bleeding out (causing loss of points)
