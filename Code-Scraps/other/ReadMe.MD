# Code Scraps
Here you'll find whatever code we're tossing around or noting down that we don't want the bot to be aware of.<br>
This can be anything from a rough module framework that isn't ready for beta testing to a block of code we want to reference later on.<br>
Nothing in this folder is loaded by any of the bots, hence it being the safe 'reference' or 'dumping' ground.
