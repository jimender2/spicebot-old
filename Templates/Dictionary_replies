## TODO update this, if in doubt just copy paste one you know works?


# replies in double [[]] will be preserved as a list of things to say

# $input will be replaced by the complete string input if any

# "time.sleep(5)" will be evaluated to make a command wait X seconds

# $instigator will be replaced with person who started command

# *a at the beggining will make the bot do an action

# "specialcase": {
#                "canada": {
#                          "replies": ["Blame Canada!!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOR38552MJA"],
#                          "inputrequired": False,
#                          },
#                },
# use this to allow a special reply if user input starts with the key, inputrequired = False if you are bypassing $blank and $target

# $channel will be replaced with the current channel

# $botnick will be replaced with bot.nick

# reply types set to a filename or url should* do that

# prefix,,, text to precede randomly chosen

# suffix,,, text to follow randomly chosen
# "suffixtext": "$instigator puts a nickel in the jukebox and it starts to play ",
